# Lima-Plus Design System

## Design Philosophy

### Core Values
- **Climate-First**: Every design decision reflects our commitment to environmental sustainability and climate resilience
- **Farmer-Centered**: Accessible, intuitive design that serves smallholder farmers with varying literacy levels
- **Trustworthy**: Professional aesthetic that builds confidence among partners, donors, and farming communities
- **Nature-Inspired**: Visual language drawn from Uganda's agricultural landscape and natural ecosystems

### Visual Language
- **Organic Shapes**: Rounded corners, flowing lines, and natural curves that mirror the agricultural environment
- **Layered Depth**: Subtle shadows and elevation that evoke soil layers and natural topography
- **Breathing Space**: Generous whitespace that allows content to breathe, reflecting open farmland spaces
- **Tactile Elements**: Design components that feel approachable and human, avoiding sterile corporate aesthetics

## Color Palette

### Primary Colors
- **Deep Forest Green** (#1B4332): Primary brand color, representing growth, resilience, and Uganda's rich vegetation
- **Sage Green** (#52796F): Secondary green, lighter and more approachable for backgrounds and accents
- **Warm Earth** (#A0522D): Warm brown representing healthy soil and agricultural foundation
- **Golden Harvest** (#D4A574): Soft yellow representing crop yields and agricultural success

### Supporting Colors
- **Climate Alert Orange** (#E67E22): For warnings and urgent climate information
- **Success Green** (#27AE60): For positive outcomes and achievements
- **Neutral Gray** (#7F8C8D): For supporting text and subtle elements
- **Pure White** (#FFFFFF): Clean backgrounds and text contrast

### Color Usage Guidelines
- Maintain 4.5:1 contrast ratio minimum for all text
